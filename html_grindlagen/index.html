<p class="cp"><i><b>The cat</b> (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the
    domestic cat or house cat, is the only domesticated species in the family
    Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
    domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.
    It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a
    feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and
    its ability to kill vermin.</i>.</p>

    The origin of the English word cat, Old English cat, is thought to be the Late
    Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century.
    The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African language.
    The Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat' and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.
    The Nubian word may be a
    loan from Arabic.
    The forms might also have derived from an ancient Germanic word
    that was imported into Latin and then into Greek, Syriac,
    and Arabic.The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern
    European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf.
    Northern Sámi gáđfi, 'female stoat', and Hungarian hölgy, 'lady, female stoat';
    from Proto-Uralic, 'female (of a furred animal)'.Some kinds are following:
